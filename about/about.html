                <h3>The Competition</h3>
                <p id="img"><br clear="right"/><img src="../images/logos/frc.png" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="10"/>FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a youth STEM organization, founded in 1989 with a goal of inspiring young people's interest in science and technology. FIRST is the organization responsible for the creation of innovative and competitive challenges, such as FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), and FIRST Lego League (FLL). Titan Robotics is an FRC Team (2022), participating in the worldwide robotics competition for high school students in which students have six weeks to create a robot based on the yearly challenge.

            <div class="teamHistory">
                <h3>Beginnings</h3>
                <p>FRC Team 2022, Titan Robotics, was founded in fall 2006 at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) in Aurora, Illinois. With three members and one adult mentor, Titan's first season was one of scarcity, with only hand tools in a small, carpeted club room. Since then, the team has grown to more than 70 members and 16 mentors, while remaining student-led. With mentor guidance, veteran students lead project groups and ensure that every student has a chance to work hands-on with the robot.</p>

                <h3>Mentors</h3>
                <p>Titan Robotics Mentors are IMSA employees, team members' parents, retired Caterpillar engineers, computer science and robotics professors from nearby universities,  students from nearby universities, among others. Without their supervision, we would not be able to exist, and without their guidance, we would not be able to thrive. We love our mentors! <br><br>If you would like to be a mentor, get in touch with us at <a id="email" href="mailto:titan2022robotics@gmail.com" target="_top">titan2022robotics@gmail.com</a>!

                <h3>Last Season</h3>
                <p>The past fiscal year brought many obstacles to Titan Robotics. Regardless of these challenges, we have come far, beginning with close to no funds and an insecure immediate future, to attending two competitions: the Midwest Regional competition and the St. Louis Regional competition. At the latter, we received our first award in four years, the <span id="bold">Entrepreneurship Award</span>, showing the team’s exemplary connection and networking abilities and comprehensive business plan. Additionally, the FIRST organization recognized Anisha Gubba, head of Business Team, as a finalist for the <span id="bold">FIRST Dean’s List Award</span>, due to her contribution to our team this year. Due to our hard work, this year our team transitioned into a fully student-operated organization through the creation of the business team. Before this season, the work of the business team was managed by our school’s business office, which limited our network and support system. Now, though we work through the business office, we meet with them regularly and work with them to find grants and sponsorships. We are also allowed to do our own networking.</p>

            <div class="outreach">
                <h3>Outreach</h3>
                <p>Although Titan Robotics is an FRC team, we have helped start numerous FTC, FLL, and FRC teams. We encourage these teams to work hard and demonstrate a culture of FIRST’s core values. Mentors are coached on the FIRST principal of student initiative, while guiding the team along with lessons on everything from technical skills to professional collaboration to team building. As students of a boarding school that draws from the entire state of Illinois, individual Titans also help in their local communities and at various outreach events by volunteering at regional competition, training FLL mentors, and volunteering at STEM summer camps. On a more centralized level, Titan Robotics organized two volunteer trips to FLL competitions and one to an FTC competition during last season.</p>
