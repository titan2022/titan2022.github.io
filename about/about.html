            <h3>Beginnings</h3>
            <p>FRC Team 2022, Titan Robotics, was founded in fall 2006 at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) in Aurora, Illinois. With three members and one adult mentor, Titan's first season was one of scarcity, with only hand tools in a small, carpeted club room. Since then, the team has grown to more than 70 members and 16 mentors, while remaining student-led. With mentor guidance, veteran students lead project groups and ensure that every student has a chance to work hands-on with the robot.</p>

            <h3>Last Season</h3>
            <p>Entrepreneurship Award at St. Louis Regional<br>Dean's List Finalist Award at St. Louis Regional<br><br>The past fiscal year brought many obstacles to Titan Robotics. Regardless of these challenges, we have come far, beginning with close to no funds and insecure immediate future, to attending two competitions: the Midwest Regional competition and the St. Louis Regional competition. At the latter, we received our first award in four years, the Entrepreneurship Award, showing the team’s exemplary connection and networking abilities and comprehensive business plan. Additionally, the FIRST organization recognized Anisha Gubba, head of Business Team, as a finalist for the FIRST Dean’s List Award, due to her contribution to our team this year. Due to our hard work, this year our team transitioned into a fully student-operated organization through the creation of the business team. Before this season, the work of the business team was managed by our school’s business office, which limited our network and support system. Now, though we work through the business office, we meet with them regularly and work with them to find grants and sponsorships. We are also allowed to do our own networking.</p>
